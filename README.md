# COSAS

COSAS &mdash; or the **C**atalogue of **S**equences, **A**rrays, and **S**amples &mdash; runs on the [Unified Molgenis Data Model](https://github.com/molgenis/rd-datamodel). This repository contains all of the files and code required for maintaining the COSAS database, as well as additional EMX files that were built specifically for this project.

All EMX models are located in `src/emx/`. These models are created at build time using the [yamlemxconvert](https://pypi.org/project/yamlemxconvert/) python library. See [index.py](https://github.com/molgenis/molgenis-cosas/tree/main/src/index.py) for more information.
